ppm-cut-detection
=================

Graduate project related to automatic transition detection in video.  The code can read in a sequence of video frames and determine the exact frame that transitions occur.  The detection algorithm used in the program can detect cuts with a very high degree of accuracy.  It also does reasonably well on gradual transitions but needs improvement in this area.
